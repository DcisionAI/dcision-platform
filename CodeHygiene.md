# Code Hygiene and Refactoring Report

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the significant code cleanup and refactoring efforts undertaken to improve the health, performance, and maintainability of the `dcisionai-platform` codebase. The primary goal was to identify and remove unused code, dependencies, and legacy files, resulting in a more streamlined and efficient application.

The analysis was performed using the `knip` tool, which provided a comprehensive report on unused files, exports, and dependencies.

## 2. Unused File Deletion

A substantial number of unused files were identified and removed from the codebase. These files were remnants of previous architectural patterns, example templates, or temporary test files.

### 2.1. Deleted Directories

-   **`server/`**: This entire directory was removed as it contained a legacy Express-based server architecture that has been superseded by the Next.js API routes in `src/pages/api`.

### 2.2. Deleted Files

The following files were deleted:

-   **Backup Files**:
    -   `src/pages/api/_lib/dcisionai-agents/test-refactored-agents.ts.bak`
    -   `src/pages/api/_lib/dcisionai-agents/test-intent-routing.ts.bak`
    -   `src/pages/api/_lib/dcisionai-agents/constructionWorkflow.ts.bak`
    -   `src/pages/api/_lib/dcisionai-agents/example-usage.ts.bak`

-   **Test & Temporary Files**:
    -   `test-highs-simple.js`
    -   `test-mcp-integration.js`
    -   `tmp.js`
    -   `tmp2.js`

-   **Unused Scripts**:
    -   `scripts/export-vector-ids.ts`
    -   `scripts/sample-data.js`
    -   `scripts/test-static-dashboard.js`
    -   `scripts/upsertDocsToPinecone.ts`

-   **Unused Components**:
    -   `src/components/AgentConversation.tsx`
    -   `src/components/ApiInterface.tsx`
    -   `src/components/ConstructionTabs.tsx`
    -   `src/components/DashboardTab.tsx`
    -   `src/components/DynamicDashboard.tsx`
    -   `src/components/ui/typewriter-effect.tsx`
    -   `src/components/WorkflowDiagram.tsx`

## 3. Dependency Cleanup

The `package.json` file was updated to remove all unused dependencies and dev dependencies. This reduces the project's bundle size, decreases `node_modules` size, and improves installation speed.

### 3.1. Removed Dependencies

-   `@dnd-kit/core`
-   `@dnd-kit/sortable`
-   `@dnd-kit/utilities`
-   `@monaco-editor/react`
-   `@supabase/auth-ui-react`
-   `@supabase/auth-ui-shared`
-   `@supabase/ssr`
-   `@types/cors`
-   `@types/express-rate-limit`
-   `@types/jsonwebtoken`
-   `@types/pino`
-   `@types/react-syntax-highlighter`
-   `agno` (the local package is no longer used as a dependency)
-   `cors`
-   `firebase-admin`
-   `gray-matter`
-   `jsonwebtoken`
-   `monaco-editor`
-   `next-themes`
-   `rate-limiter-flexible`
-   `react-syntax-highlighter`
-   `remark`
-   `remark-parse`
-   `unified`

### 3.2. Removed Dev Dependencies

-   `@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli`
-   `@testing-library/react`
-   `@testing-library/user-event`
-   `@types/body-parser`
-   `@types/markdown-to-jsx`
-   `ignore-loader`
-   `null-loader`

## 4. Next Steps & Recommendations

-   **Regularly Run `knip`**: It is recommended to run `knip` periodically (e.g., as part of a CI/CD pipeline) to prevent the accumulation of unused code in the future.
-   **Resolve Unresolved Imports**: The `knip` report identified 9 unresolved imports, primarily in test files. These should be fixed to ensure the test suite is fully operational.
-   **Review Unused Exports**: While many unused exports were in generated SDK code, there may be others in the application code that can be cleaned up. A further review of the `knip` report is recommended.
-   **Update `tsconfig.json`**: With the removal of the `server/` directory, the `tsconfig.json` may benefit from a review to ensure all path aliases and configurations are still relevant.
