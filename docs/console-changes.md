# Console Changes for Agent/LLM Platform Features

This document tracks all required and recommended changes to the DcisionAI console UI to support the new agent-based, LLM-powered platform architecture.

---

## 1. Expose Agent Thought Process in UI
- Display the `thoughtProcess` returned by each agent in the MCP orchestration results.
- Show LLM reasoning/explanation to users for transparency and trust.
- (Optional) Allow users to toggle between raw output and explanation.

## 2. Customer Feedback Mechanism
- Add thumbs up/down or comment box for each agent step result.
- Store and surface feedback for continuous improvement.

## 3. Agent Execution Trace
- Visualize the sequence of protocol steps and which agent handled each.
- Show status (success, error, in progress) for each step.

## 4. Migration Journey Onboarding
- Add a "How Migration Works" or "Getting Started" section.
- Guide users: "Describe your problem, connect your data, and let our agents do the rest."
- Show sample flows and screenshots.

## 5. LLM/Agent Configuration (Advanced)
- Allow users to select LLM model or agent for certain steps (future/advanced).
- Expose agent registry and capabilities in the UI for power users.
