### GPT-4o-mini Integration & Enhanced Model Builder
- **Model Provider Migration**: Successfully migrated the DcisionAI platform from Claude to GPT-4o-mini as the default model for the Enhanced Model Builder, providing significant performance and cost benefits (2x faster, 60x cheaper than GPT-4o).
- **Enhanced Model Builder**: Implemented a comprehensive multi-strategy model builder that combines dynamic AI generation, template-based fallback, and AI-generated fallback approaches for robust optimization model creation.
- **Dynamic Model Builder**: Created a new `DynamicModelBuilder` class that uses AI (GPT-4o-mini) to generate, validate, and convert optimization models dynamically from user input and enriched data, eliminating hardcoded solutions.
- **Configuration System**: Built a centralized model configuration system (`modelConfig.ts`) that allows easy switching between different model providers and models, with environment variable support for deployment flexibility.
- **Agent Orchestrator Updates**: Updated the `AgentOrchestrator` to use the enhanced model builder with GPT-4o-mini, including detailed logging for model building results and performance tracking.
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Created comprehensive test scripts (`test-simple-gpt4o.ts`, `test-gpt4o-mini.ts`) to verify GPT-4o-mini integration and compare performance across different models.
- **Documentation**: Created detailed documentation (`GPT4O_MINI_INTEGRATION.md`) explaining the integration, configuration options, best practices, and troubleshooting guides.

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Model Builder Agent**: Updated `agnoModelBuilderAgent.ts` to use GPT-4o-mini by default with proper fallback strategies.
- **Enhanced Model Builder**: Implemented `enhancedModelBuilder.ts` with three-tier approach: dynamic AI generation → template-based → AI fallback.
- **Dynamic Model Builder**: Created `dynamicModelBuilder.ts` for AI-powered model generation with validation and conversion capabilities.
- **Configuration Management**: Built `modelConfig.ts` with performance comparisons, environment variable support, and agent-specific configurations.
- **Index Exports**: Updated `index.ts` to properly export all model builder classes for better module resolution.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Successfully tested the complete orchestration pipeline using curl commands, confirming GPT-4o-mini integration works correctly.

### Performance & Cost Benefits
- **Speed**: GPT-4o-mini is 2x faster than GPT-4o for model generation
- **Cost**: 60x cheaper than GPT-4o while maintaining excellent mathematical reasoning capabilities
- **Reliability**: Excellent JSON generation for optimization model structures
- **Rate Limits**: Higher rate limits than GPT-4o for better throughput

### Testing Results
- **End-to-End Test**: Successfully tested crew assignment optimization with 15 workers across 4 project phases
- **Model Generation**: Generated valid MIP model with 4 variables, 4 constraints, and optimal solution
- **Solution Quality**: Achieved optimal solution with 5 carpenters, 3 electricians, 2 plumbers, 5 overtime hours
- **Explanation Generation**: Produced comprehensive explanation with key decisions, recommendations, and insights

### HiGHS Solver Solution Parsing Fix
- **Duplicate Solution Entries**: Identified and fixed a critical issue in the HiGHS solution parser where both primal and dual solution values were being included in the solution array, causing duplicate entries and incorrect results.
- **Solution File Format**: The HiGHS solver outputs solution files containing both primal solution values (actual variable assignments) and dual solution values (shadow prices/reduced costs). The parser was incorrectly reading both sections.
- **Parser Enhancement**: Updated the `parseHiGHSOutput` method in `src/pages/api/_lib/solvers/highs.ts` to properly distinguish between primal and dual solution sections, ensuring only the correct primal values are extracted.
- **Testing & Validation**: Created and ran a comprehensive test to verify the fix works correctly, confirming that only 4 variables are now returned instead of 8 duplicate entries.
- **Documentation Update**: Updated the HiGHS Integration Guide to document the solution parsing behavior and added a section explaining the primal vs dual solution distinction.

### Technical Details
- **Root Cause**: The parser was using a simple `inColumnsSection` flag that didn't distinguish between primal and dual sections in the HiGHS solution file.
- **Fix Implementation**: Added proper section detection with `inPrimalColumnsSection` and `inDualSection` flags to ensure only primal solution values are parsed.
- **Impact**: This fix ensures that optimization results are accurate and don't contain confusing duplicate entries, improving the reliability of the construction optimization workflow.

### Enhanced AI Assistant UI/UX
- **Three-Panel Layout**: Completely redesigned the AI Assistant interface into a modern, three-panel layout to improve usability for complex workflows. The new layout consists of:
  - **Left Panel (250px)**: A dedicated "Session History" panel to manage and switch between conversations.
  - **Center Panel (Flexible)**: The main "Chat + Responses" area.
  - **Right Panel (300px)**: A real-time "Agent Flow" panel to monitor agent progress.
- **Collapsible Panels**: Implemented smart collapsible sidebars to maximize screen real estate. The Session History panel now auto-collapses when a chat becomes active, and both side panels can be toggled manually.
- **Centralized Progress Display**: Refined the user experience by removing the redundant, inline "Agent Orchestration Progress" component from the chat stream. All agent status updates are now exclusively shown in the right-hand "Agent Flow" panel, creating a single source of truth.

### Bug Fixes & Stability
- **Build Failure Resolution**: Fixed a critical production build error caused by a TypeScript type mismatch for the `MCPConfig` interface. This was a blocker that is now resolved.
- **"Success-Error" Bug**: Corrected a confusing UI bug where the application would show a generic error message ("Sorry, there was an error") even after a successful API response, particularly for RAG queries. The logic now correctly handles API responses that may not contain all optional fields.
- **Routing & Dev Server**: Resolved 404 errors for the `/construction` page and stabilized the development environment by identifying and terminating multiple conflicting `next dev` processes.

### Model Builder Agent Enhancement (Optimization PhD)
- **Upgraded Prompt:** The Model Builder Agent's prompt was completely overhauled to give it the persona of "Dr. Sarah Chen," an Optimization PhD from MIT with 15+ years of experience. This enables the agent to create sophisticated, non-trivial optimization models from scratch when no template is available.
- **Advanced Techniques:** The new prompt instructs the agent to use advanced modeling techniques like Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), constraint programming, Big-M formulations, and solver-specific optimizations for HiGHS.
- **Agent Identity:** Updated the agent's public name and description in `agnoModelBuilderAgent.ts` to reflect its new, expert capabilities.

### Bug Fixes & Stability Improvements
1.  **Intent Agent Parsing:** Fixed a critical bug in `agnoIntentAgent.ts` where the `analyzeIntent` function would crash if the AI model returned a JSON object directly instead of a string. The logic now correctly handles both data types, preventing fallback errors.
2.  **Model Builder Robustness:** Hardened the `extractCustomizations` function in `agnoModelBuilderAgent.ts` by adding optional chaining (`?.`) to prevent crashes when the `enrichedData` payload was missing expected properties (like `costs` or `timeline`).
3.  **Solver Integration:** Corrected a major flaw in `ConstructionMCPSolver.ts`. The `solveConstructionOptimization` function was previously ignoring the incoming `mcpConfig` and creating a default, empty problem, which led to trivial "optimal" solutions with an objective value of 0. The function now correctly parses the `mcpConfig` to solve the actual problem generated by the model builder.

### Testing & Development Workflow
- **Enhanced Test Suite:** Created a new test file (`docs/test-enhanced-agents.ts`) to specifically demonstrate the capabilities of the new "Optimization PhD" model builder.
- **TypeScript Configuration:** Addressed several TypeScript module resolution issues to get the tests running, which involved:
    - Renaming the test file from `.js` to `.ts`.
    - Adding explicit type annotations to satisfy strict type checking.
    - Updating `tsconfig.json` to set `"allowImportingTsExtensions": true`.
    - Correcting import paths to include the `.ts` extension where needed.

### Agent Backend (Agno) Service: Cloud Run Productionization
- **Deployed agno-backend** as a separate Cloud Run service for agent flows (intent, data, model builder, explainability).
- **Mapped custom domain**: agents.dcisionai.com → agno-backend (Cloud Run, us-central1).
- **DNS configuration**: Added CNAME agents → ghs.googlehosted.com for SSL provisioning.
- **Platform integration**: Set AGNO_BACKEND_URL=https://agents.dcisionai.com in Cloud Run env vars for platform-dcisionai.
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - Identified ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8000 errors due to missing AGNO_BACKEND_URL in prod.
  - Fixed by deploying agno-backend and updating env vars.
  - Waited for SSL cert to provision; tested with Cloud Run URL until DNS/SSL ready.
- **Documentation**: Updated deployment and development guides to reflect new agent backend architecture, environment variables, and troubleshooting steps.
- **No impact on local development**: Local .env and Docker Compose unchanged; local agent flows use localhost.
