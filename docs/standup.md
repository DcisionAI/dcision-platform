### Enhanced AI Assistant UI/UX
- **Three-Panel Layout**: Completely redesigned the AI Assistant interface into a modern, three-panel layout to improve usability for complex workflows. The new layout consists of:
  - **Left Panel (250px)**: A dedicated "Session History" panel to manage and switch between conversations.
  - **Center Panel (Flexible)**: The main "Chat + Responses" area.
  - **Right Panel (300px)**: A real-time "Agent Flow" panel to monitor agent progress.
- **Collapsible Panels**: Implemented smart collapsible sidebars to maximize screen real estate. The Session History panel now auto-collapses when a chat becomes active, and both side panels can be toggled manually.
- **Centralized Progress Display**: Refined the user experience by removing the redundant, inline "Agent Orchestration Progress" component from the chat stream. All agent status updates are now exclusively shown in the right-hand "Agent Flow" panel, creating a single source of truth.

### Bug Fixes & Stability
- **Build Failure Resolution**: Fixed a critical production build error caused by a TypeScript type mismatch for the `MCPConfig` interface. This was a blocker that is now resolved.
- **"Success-Error" Bug**: Corrected a confusing UI bug where the application would show a generic error message ("Sorry, there was an error") even after a successful API response, particularly for RAG queries. The logic now correctly handles API responses that may not contain all optional fields.
- **Routing & Dev Server**: Resolved 404 errors for the `/construction` page and stabilized the development environment by identifying and terminating multiple conflicting `next dev` processes.

### Model Builder Agent Enhancement (Optimization PhD)
- **Upgraded Prompt:** The Model Builder Agent's prompt was completely overhauled to give it the persona of "Dr. Sarah Chen," an Optimization PhD from MIT with 15+ years of experience. This enables the agent to create sophisticated, non-trivial optimization models from scratch when no template is available.
- **Advanced Techniques:** The new prompt instructs the agent to use advanced modeling techniques like Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), constraint programming, Big-M formulations, and solver-specific optimizations for HiGHS.
- **Agent Identity:** Updated the agent's public name and description in `agnoModelBuilderAgent.ts` to reflect its new, expert capabilities.

### Bug Fixes & Stability Improvements
1.  **Intent Agent Parsing:** Fixed a critical bug in `agnoIntentAgent.ts` where the `analyzeIntent` function would crash if the AI model returned a JSON object directly instead of a string. The logic now correctly handles both data types, preventing fallback errors.
2.  **Model Builder Robustness:** Hardened the `extractCustomizations` function in `agnoModelBuilderAgent.ts` by adding optional chaining (`?.`) to prevent crashes when the `enrichedData` payload was missing expected properties (like `costs` or `timeline`).
3.  **Solver Integration:** Corrected a major flaw in `ConstructionMCPSolver.ts`. The `solveConstructionOptimization` function was previously ignoring the incoming `mcpConfig` and creating a default, empty problem, which led to trivial "optimal" solutions with an objective value of 0. The function now correctly parses the `mcpConfig` to solve the actual problem generated by the model builder.

### Testing & Development Workflow
- **Enhanced Test Suite:** Created a new test file (`docs/test-enhanced-agents.ts`) to specifically demonstrate the capabilities of the new "Optimization PhD" model builder.
- **TypeScript Configuration:** Addressed several TypeScript module resolution issues to get the tests running, which involved:
    - Renaming the test file from `.js` to `.ts`.
    - Adding explicit type annotations to satisfy strict type checking.
    - Updating `tsconfig.json` to set `"allowImportingTsExtensions": true`.
    - Correcting import paths to include the `.ts` extension where needed.
