# Investment Thesis: DcisionAI
*For Internal Review - Pre-Seed Investment & 409A Valuation Considerations*

## Executive Summary

DcisionAI represents an early-stage investment opportunity in the enterprise AI space, focused on optimizing fleet and workforce automation through their agent-based architecture and Model Context Protocol (MCP). As a pre-seed investment, we're evaluating the company primarily on its technical foundation, founder expertise, and market opportunity rather than established metrics. We propose a $3M investment at a $7M pre-money valuation ($10M post-money), with common stock valued at $0.20 per share for 409A purposes, reflecting the early-stage risk profile.

## Company Status Assessment

### Current Stage Indicators
- **Product Development**: Alpha version of platform with core Intent Interpreter and Data Agents
- **Team**: 2 technical co-founders with relevant AI/ML and optimization backgrounds
- **Customer Development**: 2 pilot discussions underway, no committed contracts
- **Funding**: $250K friends and family round, 14 months of runway at current burn
- **IP**: Provisional patents filed for Model Context Protocol orchestration framework

### Pre-Seed Stage Completeness Evaluation

| Area | Status | Assessment | Gap to Seed |
|------|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Team** | 2 technical co-founders | **Incomplete** - Missing go-to-market expertise | Need business co-founder or early GTM hire |
| **Product** | Working alpha | **On Track** - Early MVP appropriate for stage | Need pilot user feedback and iteration |
| **Market Validation** | Initial conversations | **Early** - Positive signals but limited data | Need 2-3 pilot commitments |
| **Business Model** | Hypothesized | **Incomplete** - Pricing model untested | Need validation through pilot feedback |
| **IP/Moat** | Provisional patents | **Adequate** - Technical differentiation identified | Need implementation proof points |
| **Capital Efficiency** | $18K monthly burn | **Strong** - Low burn appropriate for stage | Scaling plan needs refinement |

## Conclusion

DcisionAI presents a compelling pre-seed investment opportunity with strong technical foundations in the growing enterprise AI decision-making space. The $7M pre-money valuation reflects the company's innovative agent-based architecture and market potential, while acknowledging the early-stage risks.

We recommend proceeding with a $3M investment structured as a SAFE with standard pre-seed terms, conditional upon addressing the identified team gaps. For 409A purposes, common stock should be valued at $0.20 per share, reflecting appropriate early-stage considerations.

The completeness assessment indicates that while DcisionAI has made substantial progress on its technical foundations and shows promising market opportunity, addressing go-to-market capabilities and formalizing customer development will be critical to successful progression to the seed stage.
