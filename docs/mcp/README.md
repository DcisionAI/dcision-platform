# DcisionAI Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is DcisionAI's standardized approach to defining and solving optimization problems. It provides a structured way to specify variables, constraints, and objectives for various optimization scenarios.

## Key Features

### Standardized Problem Definition
- Define variables with types, domains, and metadata
- Specify constraints with clear mathematical relationships
- Set multiple objectives with weights and priorities

### Flexible Problem Types
- Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP)
- Resource Scheduling
- Bin Packing
- Job Shop Scheduling
- Network Flow Optimization

### Integration Capabilities
- REST API endpoints
- WebSocket real-time updates
- Custom solver integration
- Data source connectors

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- DcisionAI Platform access
- API credentials
- Basic understanding of optimization problems

### Quick Start
1. Define your problem structure
2. Configure variables and constraints
3. Set optimization objectives
4. Submit via API
