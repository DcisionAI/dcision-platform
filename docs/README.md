# DcisionAI Platform

An AgenticAI platform for AI-powered decision making and optimization.  
Deployable on any cloud, on-premises, or local infrastructure using Docker and Terraform.

## üöÄ What is DcisionAI?

DcisionAI is a modular, open platform for building, deploying, and managing AI-driven decision and optimization workflows.  
- **Cloud-agnostic:** Deploy anywhere‚ÄîAWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, or your own servers.
- **Open standards:** Uses Docker and Terraform for easy, reproducible deployments.
- **Flexible:** Bring your own database, authentication, and infrastructure.
- **AI-Powered Optimization:** GPT-4o-mini powered model builder for dynamic optimization problem generation.

## ü§ñ AI-Powered Model Builder

DcisionAI features an advanced AI-powered model builder that automatically generates optimization models from natural language descriptions:

### GPT-4o-mini Integration
- **Performance**: 2x faster than GPT-4o for model generation
- **Cost**: 60x cheaper than GPT-4o while maintaining excellent mathematical reasoning
- **Reliability**: Excellent JSON generation for optimization model structures
- **Rate Limits**: Higher rate limits for better throughput

### Multi-Strategy Approach
The Enhanced Model Builder uses a three-tier strategy:
1. **Dynamic AI Generation**: Uses GPT-4o-mini to generate models from user input and enriched data
2. **Template-Based Fallback**: Falls back to pre-built optimization templates when AI generation fails
3. **AI-Generated Fallback**: Creates simple but valid models using AI when templates aren't suitable

### Example Usage
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/dcisionai/construction/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Optimize crew assignments for our 3-story office building project. We have 15 workers available: 5 carpenters, 5 electricians, 3 plumbers, and 2 HVAC technicians. The project has 4 phases: foundation (2 weeks), framing (3 weeks), MEP installation (4 weeks), and finishing (2 weeks). Minimize project duration while ensuring safety and quality standards.",
    "useOrchestration": true,
    "sessionId": "test-session-1"
  }'
```

### Configuration
Easily switch between different AI models using environment variables:
```bash
# Use GPT-4o-mini (default)
MODEL_PROVIDER=openai
MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o-mini
USE_GPT4O_MINI=true

# Or use full GPT-4o for complex problems
MODEL_PROVIDER=openai
MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o
USE_GPT4O_MINI=false
```

## üè† On-Premises / Local Deployment

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DcisionAI/dcision-platform.git
   cd dcision-platform
   ```

2. **Copy and configure environment variables:**
   ```sh
   cp config.example.env .env
   ```
   Edit `.env` to set your database, Supabase, and other secrets.

3. **Start the platform:**
   ```sh
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

4. **Access the platform:**  
   Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` (or your server's IP/domain).

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Deployment (Terraform)

DcisionAI provides a cloud-agnostic Terraform module for automated deployment.  
**Terraform code is located in [`/terraform`](https://github.com/DcisionAI/dcision-platform/tree/main/terraform).**

### Steps:

1. **Configure your infrastructure variables:**  
   Edit `terraform/variables.tf` and/or create a `terraform.tfvars` file with your settings (Postgres host, Docker host, etc).

2. **Initialize and apply Terraform:**
   ```sh
   cd terraform
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```
   This will provision infrastructure and deploy DcisionAI using Docker.

3. **Access the platform:**  
   The output will provide the URL or IP address for your deployment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- A PostgreSQL database (self-hosted, managed, or cloud)
- (Optional) Supabase project for authentication and storage

---

## üì¶ Updating

To update, simply pull the latest image and restart:
```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/dcisionai/dcision-platform:latest
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```
