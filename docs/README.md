## Session Context & Next Steps

### Current State (as of last session)
- **Agentic Architecture**: Fully event-driven, message bus-based, with agents subscribing/publishing to events. No central orchestrator; Coordinator Agent (LLM-powered) handles dynamic routing.
- **Agent Types**: Core (Intent, Data, Model Builder, Solver, Explain) and Advanced (Critique, Debate, Coordinator, MultiAgentDebate). All agents interact via the message bus.
- **Debate & Critique**: DebateAgent and MultiAgentDebate enable structured, LLM-powered agent-to-agent debates and group discussions. CritiqueAgent reviews outputs. All are coordinated via the message bus.
- **UI/UX**: Agent Collaboration tab shows agent thinking (cards per agent), Agent Response tab shows only the final answer. Progress logs are streamed post-response for now.
- **MCP Protocol**: Remains the universal interface for optimization, with rich context and extensibility.

### Recent Technical Changes
- Refactored all agent communication to use the message bus (no direct calls or central orchestration).
- Implemented CoordinatorAgent for LLM-based dynamic routing and workflow control.
- Added CritiqueAgent and DebateAgent for output review and agent-to-agent debate.
- MultiAgentDebate supports group debates, consensus, and winner determination.
- UI/UX improvements: Palantir-style tabs, agent cards, and clear separation of agent thinking vs. final answer.
- Bug fixes: Hooks in render, ReactMarkdown errors, correct property mapping for agent responses.

### Open Questions / Next Steps
- How to enable persistent agent memory and learning (Level 3+ agentic maturity)?
- Should agents be allowed to self-initiate or self-improve (true autonomy)?
- How to support real-time, in-progress streaming of agent logs (not just post-response)?
- What are the best practices for agent self-assessment and emergent behavior?
- Security, scalability, and test coverage need further investment.

**For the next agent session:**
- Review this section for full context before making changes.
- Consider the open questions above and document any architectural or design decisions.
- Ensure all new agents or features use the message bus and follow the agentic event-driven pattern.
