// Uses GPT-4o-mini by default
const builder = new EnhancedModelBuilder();

// Explicit configuration
const builder = new EnhancedModelBuilder('openai', 'gpt-4o-mini', true);
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Use GPT-4o-mini (default)
MODEL_PROVIDER=openai
MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o-mini
USE_GPT4O_MINI=true

# Use full GPT-4o for complex problems
MODEL_PROVIDER=openai
MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o
USE_GPT4O_MINI=false
```

### API Testing
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/dcisionai/construction/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Optimize crew assignments for our 3-story office building project...",
    "useOrchestration": true,
    "sessionId": "test-session-1"
  }'
```

## üîÑ Fallback Strategy

The Enhanced Model Builder uses a robust three-tier approach:

1. **Dynamic AI Generation** (Primary)
   - Uses GPT-4o-mini to generate models from user input
   - Validates and converts to MCP format
   - Confidence threshold: 0.7+

2. **Template-Based Fallback** (Secondary)
   - Uses pre-built optimization templates
   - Customizes with user data and intent
   - Confidence threshold: 0.6+

3. **AI-Generated Fallback** (Tertiary)
   - Creates simple but valid models using AI
   - Ensures system always returns a working model
   - Confidence threshold: 0.3+
