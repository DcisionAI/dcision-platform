# DcisionAI Platform Architecture Overview

## Introduction

DcisionAI is a modern platform for operations research and optimization, built around the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This document provides a high-level overview of the platform's architecture, components, and their interactions.

## System Architecture

The platform is built using a microservices architecture with the following main components:

1. **Frontend Application**
   - Next.js-based web application
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - React components for UI

2. **Backend Services**
   - Node.js/TypeScript services
   - RESTful APIs
   - WebSocket support for real-time updates
   - Authentication and authorization

3. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**
   - Core protocol implementation
   - Agent-based architecture
   - Orchestration layer
   - Problem-solving pipeline

4. **Data Storage**
   - Supabase for user data and authentication
   - File-based storage for models and examples
   - Caching layer for performance

## Key Components

### 1. Frontend Architecture
- **Pages**: Next.js pages for different views
- **Components**: Reusable UI components
- **Contexts**: React contexts for state management
- **API Clients**: Generated API clients for backend communication

### 2. Backend Architecture
- **API Routes**: Next.js API routes for backend services
- **Services**: Business logic and data processing
- **Middleware**: Authentication, rate limiting, etc.
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time communication

### 3. MCP Implementation
- **Protocol Definition**: Type definitions and interfaces
- **Agent System**: Specialized agents for different tasks
- **Orchestrator**: Coordination of agent activities
- **Problem Solving**: Model building and solving

### 4. Data Layer
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Storage**: File system for models
- **Cache**: In-memory and distributed caching
- **Search**: Full-text search capabilities

## Communication Flow

1. **User Interaction**
   - User actions trigger frontend events
   - API calls to backend services
   - Real-time updates via WebSocket

2. **Problem Solving**
   - Problem definition through MCP
   - Agent orchestration
   - Solution generation and validation
   - Results delivery to user

3. **Data Flow**
   - User data → Database
   - Model data → File storage
   - Cache updates → In-memory/Redis
   - Search indexing → Search engine

## Security Architecture

1. **Authentication**
   - Supabase Auth
   - JWT tokens
   - Session management

2. **Authorization**
   - Role-based access control
   - Resource-level permissions
   - API route protection

3. **Data Security**
   - Encryption at rest
   - Secure communication
   - Input validation
   - Rate limiting

## Deployment Architecture

1. **Development**
   - Local development environment
   - Docker containers
   - Hot reloading

2. **Staging**
   - Preview deployments
   - Integration testing
   - Performance testing

3. **Production**
   - Containerized deployment
   - Load balancing
   - Monitoring and logging
   - Backup and recovery

## Monitoring and Observability

1. **Logging**
   - Application logs
   - Error tracking
   - Performance metrics

2. **Monitoring**
   - System health
   - Performance metrics
   - User analytics

3. **Alerting**
   - Error notifications
   - Performance alerts
   - Security alerts

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability**
   - Horizontal scaling
   - Load balancing
   - Caching strategies

2. **Extensibility**
   - Plugin architecture
   - Custom agent support
   - API versioning

3. **Performance**
   - Optimization strategies
   - Caching improvements
   - Database optimization
