## Conclusion

This comprehensive table clearly shows the relationship between burn rate and reserves across the three key timeframes:

1. **12-Month Funding:** Provides minimal runway with appropriate reserves for early development phases.

2. **18-Month Funding (Recommended):** Balances conservative planning with efficient capital use, giving the team sufficient time to reach significant development milestones while maintaining appropriate reserves.

3. **24-Month Funding (Optimal):** Provides maximum stability and development continuity, allowing for complex product development cycles and market adaptation with substantial reserves for contingencies.

The 35% reserve allocation ensures appropriate risk mitigation while recognizing the inherent uncertainties in software development timelines and market conditions. This financial strategy gives your Mumbai development team the stability needed for high-quality AI/ML development while maintaining prudent financial management practices.
