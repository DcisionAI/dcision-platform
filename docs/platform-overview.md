## Platform Architecture

### Choreographed Agentic AI Layer

Our platform features a sophisticated **choreographed multi-agent system** with event-driven communication:

```typescript
// Core Decision Agents
interface CoreAgents {
  intentAgent: "Analyzes user intent and problem classification";
  dataAgent: "Handles data preparation and validation";
  modelBuilderAgent: "Creates optimization models and constraints";
  solverAgent: "Executes mathematical optimization";
  responseAgent: "Assembles final responses from multiple agents";
}

// Advanced Agentic Agents
interface AdvancedAgents {
  knowledgeAgent: "Handles RAG and document retrieval";
  explainAgent: "Generates explanations and insights";
  critiqueAgent: "Reviews and critiques other agents' outputs";
  debateAgent: "Engages in structured debates with other agents";
  coordinatorAgent: "Uses LLM to dynamically route messages";
}
```

### ChoreographedOrchestrator

The **ChoreographedOrchestrator** is the central workflow coordinator that manages the entire multi-agent decision process:

```typescript
interface ChoreographedOrchestrator {
  // Workflow Management
  startWorkflow(event: UserQueryEvent): Promise<void>;
  handleAgentEvent(event: AgentEvent): void;
  completeWorkflow(session: WorkflowSession): Promise<void>;
  
  // Session Management
  workflowSessions: Map<string, WorkflowSession>;
  timeoutHandlers: Map<string, NodeJS.Timeout>;
  
  // Event Routing
  triggerIntentAnalysis(event: Message): Promise<void>;
  triggerDataPreparation(event: Message): Promise<void>;
  triggerModelBuilding(event: Message): Promise<void>;
  triggerResponseGeneration(event: Message): Promise<void>;
}
```

### Event-Driven Message Bus System

**Event-Driven Communication:**
- Agents publish and subscribe to events
- Correlation ID tracking for workflow sessions
- Real-time progress updates and agent status
- Multi-agent debate and critique orchestration
- UI/UX: Agent Response, Collaboration, Solution, and Explanation tabs

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

**Standardized Optimization:**
- Universal protocol across industries
- HiGHS solver integration
- Rich context management
- Extensible design for new domains

## Choreographed Workflow Process

                                                          ↓
                    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────┐
                    ↓                                                                             ↓
            Knowledge Retrieval Path                                              Optimization Path
                    ↓                                                                             ↓
            Knowledge Agent → Response Agent → Final Response                    Data Agent → Model Builder → Solver Agent → Response Agent → Final Response
```

### Event Flow Sequence

1. **User Query Received**
   ```
   USER_QUERY_RECEIVED → ChoreographedOrchestrator.startWorkflow()
   ```

2. **Intent Analysis**
   ```
   ChoreographedOrchestrator → Intent Agent → INTENT_IDENTIFIED
   ```

3. **Path Decision**
   ```
   INTENT_IDENTIFIED → ChoreographedOrchestrator.routeToPath()
   ```

4. **Optimization Path** (if optimization required)
   ```
   OPTIMIZATION_REQUESTED → Data Agent → DATA_PREPARED
   DATA_PREPARED → Model Builder → MODEL_BUILT
   MODEL_BUILT → Solver Agent → SOLUTION_FOUND
   SOLUTION_FOUND → Response Agent → RESPONSE_GENERATED
   ```

5. **Knowledge Path** (if knowledge retrieval required)
   ```
   KNOWLEDGE_RETRIEVAL_REQUESTED → Knowledge Agent → KNOWLEDGE_RETRIEVED
   KNOWLEDGE_RETRIEVED → Response Agent → RESPONSE_GENERATED
   ```

6. **Workflow Completion**
   ```
   RESPONSE_GENERATED → ChoreographedOrchestrator.completeWorkflow()
   WORKFLOW_COMPLETED → Final Response to User
   ```
