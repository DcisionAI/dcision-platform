# MCP Deployment & Serving: Detailed Design

## Overview
Enable users to deploy a validated MCP (Model Context Protocol) as a production endpoint. This endpoint can be called with new data for real-time optimization/decisioning, bypassing the interactive LLM/agent steps. This design aligns with best practices from Anthropic, OpenAI, and modern AI/OR platforms.

---

## 1. Workflow

### Authoring Phase (MCP Builder)
- User completes steps: Intent → Data Prep/Enrich → Model & Constraints → Preview MCP → Solve & Explain.
- The resulting MCP (model, context, protocol) is validated and ready for deployment.

### Deployment Phase
- User clicks "Deploy" in Step6Deploy.
- The MCP is registered as a new endpoint (e.g., on GCP Cloud Run, Vertex AI, or a custom service).
- The endpoint is assigned a unique URL and version.
- Metadata (creator, timestamp, version, status) is stored.

### Serving Phase
- Customers POST new data (dataset/context) to the endpoint URL.
- The endpoint loads the deployed MCP, injects the new data, and runs the solve/explain steps (skipping intent, data mapping, model definition, etc).
- Returns results (solution, explanation, etc) in real time.

## 2. API Contract for Deployed Endpoint

### **Endpoint URL**
```
POST /api/mcp/execute/{mcpIdOrVersion}
```

### **Request Body**
```json
{
  "dataset": { ... },      // New data for this solve
  "environment": { ... },  // (Optional) runtime overrides
  "parameters": { ... }    // (Optional) solver/runtime params
}
```

### **Response**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "solution": { ... },
  "explanation": { ... },
  "metrics": { ... },
  "warnings": [],
  "errors": []
}
```

## 3. Versioning & Immutability
- Each deployed MCP is immutable and versioned (e.g., `mcp-1234-v1`).
- Updates create a new version and endpoint URL.
- Old versions remain available for audit/reproducibility.

---

## 4. Security & Access Control
- Endpoints require API keys or OAuth tokens.
- Role-based access: creator, team, admin.
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention.

---

## 5. Monitoring & Observability
- Track endpoint usage, latency, errors, and solution quality.
- Expose metrics via dashboard and/or API.
- Log all requests/responses for audit.

---

## 6. Extensibility
- Allow users to redeploy/clone/update MCPs.
- Support rollback to previous versions.
- Allow custom pre/post-processing hooks (e.g., for data cleaning or result formatting).

---

## 7. Implementation Notes
- Store deployed MCPs and metadata in a database (e.g., Firestore, Postgres).
- Use GCP Cloud Run, Vertex AI, or Kubernetes for scalable endpoint hosting.
- Use the same solve/explain logic as in the interactive builder, but skip LLM/agent steps.
- Consider containerizing each MCP endpoint for isolation and scalability.

---

## 8. Example User Flow
1. User builds and validates an MCP in the console.
2. User clicks "Deploy"; MCP is registered and endpoint URL is returned.
3. User (or their app) POSTs new data to the endpoint for real-time optimization.
4. Endpoint returns solution and explanation instantly.

## 9. Open Questions
- How to handle breaking changes in MCP schema?
- How to support custom business logic or plugins per endpoint?
- How to price/limit endpoint usage for customers?

---

## 10. Next Steps
- Review and refine this design with engineering and product teams.
- Prioritize implementation tasks (MCP registry, endpoint manager, serving infra, API gateway, etc).
- Build MVP for internal/external pilot users.
